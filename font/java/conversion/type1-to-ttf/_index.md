To proceed for TYPE1 to TTF conversion, Java Font API is the main requirement.
- Get Font API directly from a [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-font) for Java based project and include libraries in your pom.xml.
- Alternatively, you can get a ZIP file from [downloads](https://downloads.aspose.com/font/java).
