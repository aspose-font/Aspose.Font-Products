p1: EOT to WOFF conversion within Java-based applications with just a few lines of code. Font API Solution for ะก++ is really easy to integrate into your product.  This Java API provides font data structure along with any glyph as well as encoding information for all the font types representing a mapping between character codes and glyph identifiers. API can render any desired glyph or text, as well as special glyphs, which can be rendered by implementing interfaces using simple graphics functionality like move point, draw line, and curve, etc.
