p1: WOFF2 to TTF conversion within ะก++-based applications with just a few lines of code. Font API Solution for ะก++ is really easy to integrate into your product.  This C++ API provides font data structure along with any glyph as well as encoding information for all the font types representing a mapping between character codes and glyph identifiers. API can render any desired glyph or text, as well as special glyphs, which can be rendered by implementing interfaces using simple graphics functionality like move point, draw line, and curve, etc.
p2: "Due to the diverse nature of gadgets, environments, a few operational systems, and many other areas to use different font formats to serve different purposes such as using different fonts on web pages, applications, and publishing. So sometimes you may face a need to transform WOFF2 font into another one of a different format to meet the required display. "
