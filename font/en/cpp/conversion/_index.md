p1: ะก++ font API can easily load, save and convert different fonts such as CFF, OpenType, Type1, and TrueType collections. It provides font data structure along with any glyph as well as encoding information for all the font types representing a mapping between character codes and glyph identifiers. API can render any desired glyph or text, as well as special glyphs, which can be rendered by implementing interfaces using simple graphics functionality like move point, draw line, and curve, etc.
p2: "Due to the diverse nature of gadgets, environments, a few operational systems, and many other areas to use different font formats to serve different purposes such as using different fonts on web pages, applications, and publishing. Sometimes there is a need to transform one font into another to meet the required display. "
p3: "We offer you ะก++ Api Solution thatsupports the next fonts as input formats: TrueType (TTF), Web Open Font Format (WOFF and WOFF2), Embedded OpenType format (EOT), Type 1, and Compact Font Format (CFF)."

title: TrueType Font to Web Open Font Format version 2.0 Conversion.
item1: API supports different fonts for reading and writing, here is the [list](https://docs.aspose.com/font/cpp/convert/#formats-supported-for-reading-andor-writing) for reading and writing. For considering TTF to WOFF2 conversion, the process is to load a font from any of the supported formats, TrueType Font for the current scenario. Use the [*SaveToFormat()*](https://reference.aspose.com/font/cpp/class/aspose.font.font#a670ea97404fd72c2e51b0e8c543c8a45) Method having two parameters output stream and [*FontSavingFormats*](https://reference.aspose.com/font/cpp/namespace/aspose.font#a93d0dcc7c00f5c7027d60e14a5433c74) Enumeration for selecting the output font format. 
item2: Finally, call the SaveToFormat() to save fonts into any of the output formats supported, currently Web Open Font Format version 2.0 WOFF2 format.
item3: To see this functionality realized in an actual cross-platform application go to [Aspose Font Converter app](https://products.aspose.app/font/conversion). There you can also find many more [API solutions](https://products.aspose.app/font/applications) to work with fonts and text.
item4: Go to the [Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/font/net/) to get all the needed information to start working with the solution, like the Tutorials for the main features or the set of articles to teach you about font, Release Notes, Developer Guide, and other useful things.
